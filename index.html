    <h3>A220</h3>
	<img src="images/A220.png" alt="A220">
    <p>The newest plane in the airbus fleet. This plane was actually developed and built by Canadian manufacturer Bombardier. Originally developed as the CSeries jet, it was later "sold" to Airbus to overcome US sanctions which would have made the CSeries a commercial failure. This jet competes with the E2 jet family as a mid-size single aisle commuter jet. It has a max capacity of 160 passangers, a max takeoff weight of 18.7 tons, and a range of 4000 miles.</p>
    <h3>A300</h3>
	<img src="images/A300.png" alt="A300">
    <p>The oldest and firt plane ever created by Airbus. The A300 was created to rival the DC-10 and L-1011, which were both 3 engine aircraft, and was able to become the first twin-engine wide body jet. The A300 has a max capacity of 250 passengers, with a max take off weight of 376000 lbs, and a max range of 4700 miles.</p>
    <h3>A310</h3>
	<img src="images/A310.png" alt="A310">
    <p>The spirititual successor of the A300, the A310 was designed to fill the market for a smaller twin-engine jet. The A310 was designed to compete with the Boeing 767, boeings first attempt a larger wide body jet. The A310 had a max capacity of 220 passangers, a max takeoff weight of 362000 lbs, and a max range of nearly 6000 miles </p>
    <h3>A320</h3>
	<img src="images/A321.jpg" alt="A321">
    <p>Airbus best selling family of jets, made up of the baby bus the A318, A319, A320, and the A321. The A320 family has also undergone a next-gen upgrade dubbed the NEO line. These jets are slated to compete against the 737 family. The A320 family has a max capacity of 240 passangers, a max takeoff weight of 223000 lbs, and a max range of 5400 miles</p>
    <h3>A330</h3>

    <p>The A330 is a twin-engine wide body jet that built off the success of the A300. It is very close to the next jet in the Airbus fleet. The A330 also had a mid life next-gen upgrade and the A330Neo Was born. The A330 has a max capacity of 460 passangers, a max take off weight of 553000 lbs, and a max range of 8300 miles. </p>

	<img src="images/A340.jpg" alt="A340">
    <p>Designed to be Airbus' transcontinental airliner that was ETOPS certified (often joked as Engines Turn or Plane Sinks, but in reality it is a certification that allows planes to fly over oceans as long as they are within a certain distance of an airport). The A340 soon became obsolete as its engines were underpowered for a plane it's size, and ETOPS designation changed allowing smaller more efficent twin-engine planes to take transcontinental flights. The A340 has a max capacity of 400 seats, a max takeoff weight of 840000 lbs, and a max range of 10000 miles. </p>
    <h3>A350</h3>
	<img src="images/A350.jpg" alt="A350">
    <p>The successor of the A340, and the latest in-house plane developed by Airbus. The A350 takes advanatage of the new ETOPS rule to make a smaller more efficent plane be a transcontinental flagship. Designed to compete with the 787, the A350 is Airbus' most technoligally effecient aircraft. The A350 has a max capacity of 370 passangers, a max takeoff weight of 703000 lbs, and a max range of 10000 miles.</p>
    <h3>A380</h3>
	<img src="images/A380.jpg" alt="A380">
    <p>The largest passanger ferrying plane in the world, and the only full double-decker jetliner. The A380 is in the top 3 largest planes in the world, after the US Air Force C-5 Galaxy. The A380 was designed to compete with the first jumbo jet ever created, the 747, that being said it has no US based clients. The A380 has a max capacity of 850 passangers, a max takeoff weight of 1300000 lbs, and a max range of 9200 miles.</p>
